Build a complete, professional full-stack web application for my Data Science project titled:
“Air Quality Insights, Weather Monitoring & Chatbot for Indian Cities.”

The web app should:

Display air quality data (AQI + pollutants) for all available cities in India.

Display current weather data for those cities.

Provide an AI chatbot that answers questions about AQI, weather, city-wise comparison, trends, and health suggestions.

Allow searching, filtering and visualizing AQI & weather data for any Indian city.

Use API keys that I will provide later, not hardcoded.

🔐 API KEYS & CONFIG (IMPORTANT)

I will give the API keys later.

You must:

Create a config or environment setup (like .env or config/keys.env).

Add placeholders there:

AQI_API_KEY=
WEATHER_API_KEY=
AI_API_KEY=


The app must read these from environment variables, NOT hardcode them.

All backend calls to AQI, weather and AI/chat must use these environment variables.

🌍 CORE REQUIREMENTS – AQI + WEATHER

All India City List & Selection

Fetch or maintain a list of Indian cities supported by the AQI + weather APIs.

Provide a search box and dropdown/filter to select any city.

Optionally allow state-wise filtering (e.g., Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu).

AQI Data Display

For the selected city, show:

AQI value

AQI category (Good / Moderate / Unhealthy / Very Unhealthy / Hazardous)

Main pollutant (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃)

Time of measurement

Also show a table or list view of AQI data for multiple cities at once (e.g., top 10 most polluted cities right now).

Weather Data Display

For the same city, show:

Temperature (°C)

Humidity (%)

Wind speed

Basic weather description (Clear, Cloudy, Rain, etc.).

Show this side-by-side with AQI in a city details panel.

Maps / Overview (optional but good)

Optional: simple map or list view showing multiple cities with their AQI levels and basic weather.

📊 DASHBOARD & DATA VISUALIZATION

Create an interactive dashboard with:

City-wise comparison of AQI for multiple cities (bar chart or table).

Time-series chart for a selected city (AQI over hours/days if API or dataset supports it).

Pollutant-level comparison (PM2.5 vs PM10 vs NO₂ etc.) for a selected city.

Combined AQI + Weather charts, e.g., AQI vs temperature/humidity to visualize relationships.

Use any of:

Plotly / Chart.js / ECharts / Matplotlib (if server-side images)

Ensure charts are interactive where possible.

🔮 (Optional but Good) PREDICTION FEATURE

Add a simple AQI prediction component for a selected city (e.g., next hour or next day) using a lightweight model or heuristic.

Show predicted AQI and category, with a short text like “AQI likely to improve/worsen”.

If prediction is too complex, you can keep it simple (even a stub with explanation text based on trends).

🤖 AI CHATBOT REQUIREMENTS

Integrate an AI chatbot using AI_API_KEY (e.g., Gemini / OpenAI – generic, code should treat it as an external AI text API).

The chatbot UI should be a floating chat button (bottom right) that opens a chat window.

The chatbot backend endpoint (e.g., /api/chat) must:

Accept user questions.

Fetch relevant data from the app (AQI & weather for cities, insights, top polluted cities, etc.).

Call the AI model with this context + the user question.

Return a friendly, easy-English answer.

The chatbot must be able to answer things like:

“What is the air quality in Delhi right now?”

“Which city in India is most polluted today?”

“Is it safe to go for a walk in Bengaluru now?”

“Compare air quality between Mumbai and Chennai.”

“Explain what AQI means in simple words.”

The AI API key must also be read from environment variables, not hardcoded.

🧑‍💻 BACKEND REQUIREMENTS

Build a backend (Node/Express or Python/FastAPI/Flask) that exposes REST APIs like:

GET /api/cities → list of Indian cities supported by AQI/Weather APIs.

GET /api/aqi?city=CityName → returns AQI + pollutant breakdown for that city.

GET /api/weather?city=CityName → returns weather data for that city.

GET /api/overview → returns AQI + weather summary for multiple cities (e.g., top N polluted, cleanest, etc.).

POST /api/chat → handles chatbot queries using AI_API_KEY and internal data.

Backend tasks:

Call AQI API using AQI_API_KEY.

Call Weather API using WEATHER_API_KEY.

Optionally cache responses for a short time to reduce API calls.

Handle errors gracefully (no crash if a city fails).

🖥️ FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS

Use a modern frontend (React / Next.js / or similar):

Pages / sections:

Home / Overview

Project title & description.

High-level stats: “Most polluted city now”, “Best city now”, etc.

All Cities AQI & Weather

Table/grid view listing Indian cities with columns: City, AQI, Category, Temp, Weather.

Search & filter bar (e.g., by city, AQI range, state).

City Details Page / Panel

On selecting a city, show:

AQI, category, main pollutant

Weather summary

Charts (time trend if possible)

Brief text explanation.

Dashboard / Analytics

Charts for:

Top polluted cities

Cleanest cities

Pollutant comparisons

AQI vs Weather.

Chatbot

Floating chat widget visible on all pages.

Conversation history view inside the chat window.

UI style:

Clean, modern, and professional.

Use cards, pastel colors, icons for pollution/weather.

Fully responsive (works on mobile and desktop).

🧱 GENERAL TECH SPECS

Frontend: React / Next.js (or similar SPA framework).

Backend: Node.js (Express) or Python (FastAPI/Flask).

Data format: JSON for all API responses.

Environment config: use .env or config folder for keys.

No hardcoded secrets in code.

✅ FINAL EXPECTATION

Generate a complete, working web app that:

Shows AQI and weather for all Indian cities supported by the APIs.

Provides search, filter, and visual dashboards.

Has an AI chatbot that uses the app’s AQI & weather data to answer questions.

Reads all keys from environment variables (AQI_API_KEY, WEATHER_API_KEY, AI_API_KEY).

Looks visually clean and is easy for users to understand.
